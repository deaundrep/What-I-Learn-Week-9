# What-I-Learn-Week-9

## Betnto-Box

*Make the picture in assets/goal.png using all the other pictures in there.

(ex.)

#app {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows:15% 20% 50% 15% ;
  grid-template-columns: 30% 40% 30% ;
  width: 826px;
  height: 936px;
}

## Bs-Paint

*Take that limited-feature app and implement even fewer features for a fake MS Paint. 
*Center everything along the vertical axis. 
*Put the 100 divs in .canvas in a 10x10 grid. 

(ex.)

function colorChange(){
    event.target.classList.remove(event.target.classList.item(1));
    event.target.classList.add(currentBrush.classList.item(1));

}

## Holy-Grid

*The CSS Grid is a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

##Todish

(ex.)

Make your global todos array here.
This is mostly to give us some data to test our functions with.

const todos = [
    `Be able to mark todos "done".`,
    `Allow user interaction through the DOM`,
    `Add dates to todos.`,
];
